# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this class we learned how programs store data, different data storage methods, and their resprective pros and cons. Along with that we learned
how to write the code associated with those data storage methods, and how to select the best method for your desired function.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I like to consider the data at hand, what it includes, and how its related to itself. Knowing each of these things beforehand, and how much data you 
have can strongly influence the data structure you select, and how it is designed.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by reviewing the course supporting materials, rewatching the videos that you made for us, and using sites like stackoverflow 
to find new ways to approach my issues. Feeling comfortalble with trial and error is important for assignements like we had in this class, and of
course when I was feeling most frustrated, stepping away for a little while and coming back to where I was stuck always helps change my thought
process and get me back on track!

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project and the associated milestones made me realize how many different ways there are to solve 1 given problem. Some are better than others
and its important to understand how to go about descerning which solution is best for the problem at hand. I really liked that we were able to 
decide for ourselves which way to write the code for problem 2. I may not have picked the ideal method, but it was cool to work through what I 
thought would be best, and realize along the way why it was not the most ideal. I think it was an important lesson and I appreciate that I was given the
opportunity to learn it

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
It made me realize how important reusable code is. Have the early projects from this class to look back on as I built the code for project was vital
to the success I felt at having a running and working project to submit. I also think I do a decent job at having readable code, as well as supporting
code comments for areas that are not as readable. This is important in case other 'coworkers' are reading through my work, it ensures they understand
my thought process in case I'm not around to help with the project anymore.
